# Rule_Based_Fraud_Model
The model is a rule-based fraud detection system that scores transactions on key risk indicatorsâ€”amount anomalies, device/session behavior, time/velocity checks, merchant/category risk, and geographic outliers. Each rule adds to a Total Risk Score, enabling clear, transparent flags for monitor, review, or decline actions.
